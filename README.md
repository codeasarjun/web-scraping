Web scraping refers to the process of extracting structured information from websites. This information can include text, images, links, metadata, and more, and it's typically extracted from HTML pages using automated tools or scripts. 🕸️

Web scraping is a crucial technique in data mining because it allows researchers, analysts, and businesses to gather large amounts of data from the internet quickly and efficiently. This data can then be analyzed, processed, and used for various purposes such as market research, competitive analysis, sentiment analysis, price monitoring, and more. 📊💼

Web scraping involves accessing and parsing HTML content from web pages, extracting relevant data using techniques like regular expressions, XPath, or libraries like BeautifulSoup in Python, and then storing this data in a structured format for further analysis. However, it's important to note that web scraping must be conducted ethically and in accordance with the terms of service of the websites being scraped to avoid legal issues. ⚖️
